<h1>Hi, I'm Ethan.</h1>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p> 
    As more of our daily lives transition into the digital realm, maintaining our privacy and individuality is imperative. 
    At Virginia Tech, I study cybersecurity in the Business Information Technology major with a minor in Human Computer Interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy speaking Spanish and meeting new people. In my free time I'm either outdoors surfing, hiking, or playing volleyball, or I'm inside playing chess and programming.


    </p>
    <p>
      I initially created this website to teach myself JavaScript. As I developed more projects, I grew more fond of HTML and CSS. This is now my space to practice programming,
      but also to exercise the creative muscles in my brain. This website evolves as my understanding of UX/UI design and programming grows over time. Be sure to head over
      to the projects section to see what I've been up to recently.
