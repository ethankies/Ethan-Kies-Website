    As more of our daily lives transitions into the digital realm, it's more important than ever to stay safe online. 
    As a Business Information Technology student at Virginia Tech, I am in pursuit of developing robust cybersecurity systems
    that protect our privacy and humanity. With a minor in Human Computer Interaction, I intend to be equipped with necessary
    design skills relating to UI/UX as I believe much of cybersecurity risk lies in human error.

      I love all things tech; this includes programming, making videos, graphic design, playing online chess, and Virginia Tech! If I'm not at a computer, I am probably outside playing
      volleyball, hiking, or surfing.
      I also enjoy speaking Spanish and meeting new people.

      Welcome to my online home! I initially created this website to teach myself JavaScript during quarantine,
       but it has since evolved into a space for me to be creative, experiment, and have fun with programming.
       I am constantly making changes and tweaking as my CSS and HTML capabilities grow over time. Be sure to head over
      to the projects section to see what I've been up to recently.
