    <h1>Simulation of How Viruses Spread</h1>
        
   
    <div class = "paragraphs" style="text-align: center;">
        <h4>Sick with COVID-19, I grew bored in Virginia Tech's quarantine dorm. I decided to model how the disease was spreading among its then unvaccinated population. </h4>
        <p>
            By letting the simulation run, a nice bell curve begins to take shape, demonstrating the exponential behavior of a disease like COVID-19.
            Click the "Reset Simulation" button then try slowing the spread by making the students social distance. The sooner social distance is implemented, the slower
            the rate of transmission.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that if R<sub>0</sub> is less than 1, the disease will not spread and will eventually die out.
            If R<sub>0</sub> is 1, the disease will remain stable in the community but will not cause an epidemic.
            If R<sub>0</sub> is greater than 1, the disease will spread and may cause an epidemic.

    <!--Virus Spread Simulation: This is a very cool project, but there is very little of an explanation of what's happening, or how you can shift the simulation. 
        For example, what does the "Social Distance" button do? Do you need to select and hold it for it to react/change? Also, the color key could be closer to the 
        "floating dots," and maybe use a colored dot next to the word of the color, just for a visual tie. -->
